This project is a **Nuxt Layer** that functions as a design system for Nuxt applications. It contains shared components, styles, and configurations.

## Usage as Nuxt Layer

To use this project as a library in another Nuxt project, follow these steps:

### 1. Installation

Install the package using NPM (or your preferred package manager):

```bash
npm install design-system-dashboard-devmunity
```

### 2. Configuration in Nuxt

In the project where you want to use the design system, add the package to the `extends` property in your `nuxt.config.ts` file:

```typescript
// nuxt.config.ts
export default defineNuxtConfig({
    extends: ['design-system-dashboard-devmunity'],
})
```

And that's it! Nuxt will automatically load the components, composables, assets, and configuration from this layer into your project.

> [!note]
> 🚀 The component library is currently being migrated from an older version, so you'll see new pieces arriving here very soon!
