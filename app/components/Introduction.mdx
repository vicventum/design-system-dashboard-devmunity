This design system has been conceived as a robust and scalable infrastructure for creating unified **Dashboards**. Its main objective is to optimize the development cycle through a library of preconfigured components specifically designed for a defined Dashboard design, ensuring visual and functional consistency without sacrificing the flexibility necessary for brand adaptations.

## Underlying Architecture

The library is built on **Nuxt UI**, which means all its components are available to developers. However, the main focus is creating specialized components that incorporate predefined styles and functionalities specifically adapted for the dashboard design used as a base.

For example, instead of using `UModal` from Nuxt UI directly and customizing it from scratch, the system provides `BModal`, a component that extends `UModal` with additional features and preconfigured design for immediate use.

In this way, unlike a traditional component library, this system acts as a semantic abstraction layer that:

1.  **Accelerates development:** Provides components with integrated base design for common dashboard use cases.
2.  **Maintains flexibility:** Leverages Nuxt UI's theming capabilities and Tailwind CSS variables to allow deep customizations (colors, borders, spacing) through centralized configuration files.
3.  **Encapsulates complexity:** Instead of configuring third-party components from scratch in each view, we use intelligent "Wrappers" (like `BModal` over `UModal`) that already contain the specific logic and styles of our ecosystem.

## Technology Stack

This system is aligned with the latest versions of leading technologies in the Vue ecosystem:

- **Framework:** [Nuxt 4](https://nuxt.com/) (Directory structure `app/`, auto-imports and high performance).
- **UI Library:** [@nuxt/ui 4](https://ui.nuxt.com/) (Base of accessible and customizable components).
- **Styling:** [Tailwind CSS 4](https://tailwindcss.com/) (Next-generation utility engine).
- **Documentation:** [Storybook 9](https://storybook.js.org/) (Development and testing of components in isolation).
