The color tokens within this design system encapsulates a rich palette of semantic colors, each with specific
roles and shades to cater to various UI elements and states.

- The `primary` colors, with shades ranging from light blue (#ebf5ff) to deep blue (#1c044f), form the core visual identity, suitable for branding elements and primary actions.
- The `secondary` colors shift towards purple (#f5f4ff to #401d7b), providing a sophisticated contrast ideal for secondary actions or highlighting important UI elements without overpowering the primary hue.
- The `accent` color spectrum, from a soft yellow (#fcfce7) to a dark burnt yellow (#401b06), is designed to draw attention to specific components or prompts, making it perfect for call-to-action buttons or interactive elements.
- The `info` colors, transitioning from a light sky blue (#eaf4ff) to a deep sky blue (#1b274f), are tailored for informational messages and neutral communications, providing clarity without invoking urgency or emotion.
- The `success` shades signify positive actions or confirmations, with a vibrant green (#f4faf7 to #002d23) that should be used to indicate completion, approval, or progress.
- The `warning` palette, transitioning from a light orange (#fff7ef) to a dark orange (#641a1a), is tailored for cautionary messages or to highlight areas that require user attention.
- The `error` colors range from a soft red (#fcf1f1) to a dark red (#410a0a), ideal for error messages, critical warnings, or delete actions, signaling users to proceed with caution.
- Lastly, the `neutral` collection, with shades from pure white (#ffffff) to pure black (#000), provides a neutral backdrop suited for text, backgrounds, and UI frames, ensuring legibility and a muted contrast against more vibrant colors.

Although it is recommended not to use colors directly and instead use semantic colors for maintainability, there will be specific cases where it will be necessary to use a raw color, for example for those elements where you want the color to prevail even if there is a change of theme, such as the use of neutral colors like `white`, `black`, or options like `transparent` and `currentColor` are valid in some cases where flexibility is required, but without neglecting a consistent and accessible user interface throughout the design system.
